      <p>I was that obnoxious, provocative kid, the one who’d squint at you and draaaag out doubtfully — <strong>“And why is that??!”</strong>, never satisfied with the answer, “That’s just how it is.”</p>
      <p>I absolutely love asking questions. I want to understand things.</p>
      <p>Adults have found a nicer way to put it &mdash; they call me ‘thought-provoking’ now. But let’s be honest, the gist hasn’t changed. Curiosity can inspire just as much as it can drive you mad.</p>
      <p>A friend of mine wondered why, the moment we walked into a hotel room, I’d immediately start checking all the doors and drawers. He thought I was after those fancy shampoo bottles. I’M GATHERING INFORMATION, can’t you see?! 😊 I want to see what’s going on in here.</p>
      <p>Well, I'm not a saint. I’m sure did take some of those...</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 30px;">But information-gathering first. It’s not something I do on purpose. Over time, I realized that it’s just <i>my thing</i>. I want to understand the current situation, so that I can potentially find a way to improve it.</p>
      <p>I believe information can give us valuable insights, deeper understanding, and make things more efficient. In turn, leading to improved quality of life and a stronger sense of well-being.</p>

      <p>Want to ask me why?</p>
