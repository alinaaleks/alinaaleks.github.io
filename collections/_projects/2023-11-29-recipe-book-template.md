My idea here is not to just create a recipe book. My idea is to provide you
with a tool which will serve you in making your cooking more enjoyable,
eating - healthier and time for recipe search - shorter.

Tags! Type of dish, type of food, preparation style, cuisine? sometimes its
obvious, sometimes I google it, sometimes I put it by association.

Setting a tag try to use variation from each category - this way you enrich
your searching.

Quae quidem sapientes sequuntur duce natura tamquam videntes; Quod enim dissolutum sit, id esse sine sensu, quod autem sine sensu. Sunt omnia Longum est enim ad omnia respondere, quae a te dicta sunt. Nam cui proposito sit conservatio sui, necesse est huic partes quoque sui caras suo genere laudabiles servari.
