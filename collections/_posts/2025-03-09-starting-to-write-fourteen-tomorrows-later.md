It’s interesting **how we sometimes need reminders even about our important decisions.** This post serves as a reminder of why I decided to start writing.

## Intro

When I was reading about Analysts and Data Scientists, gathering information on what to learn and which resources to use, I came across many different opinions about the field. Some said that dedication alone is enough to succeed, while others emphasized the need for smarts, strong math skills, and more.

So, where's the truth? And am I smart enough to pull this off?

## My answers

As a sign of support, I thought to do something that helps me grow. Writing sounds good. I will learn something new. At least, I'll learn how to form my thoughts better. At most, trying to form my thoughts, I understand the topic deeper. They say

> If you can explain it in simple terms, you understand the topic.

So, I thought I will be just writing posts on Medium, make projects on GitHub, all casual. Which evolved pretty soon 🤭 and I created my own cozy space for that - this website. [1 - link below, on website creation]

## "Starting Today"

Ever since the idea of writing came to me, this line from Elvis' song has been playing louder and louder in my head. Even though it’s about romance, these two words had stood out.

Yet actually it took me **14 ‘tomorrows’!**

It was the calm before the storm.

It was the planning before action. [2 - link below, on planning]

Thank you, Elvis, for putting up with me this long.
