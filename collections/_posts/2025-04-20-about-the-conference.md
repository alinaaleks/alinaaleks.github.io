I have been to the **Data Conference** this April in Moscow. It lasted for 2 days, and I can honestly say I heard A LOT of unfamiliar words.

I’m not going to unpack it all here, but I'd like to highlight a few things that struck me as meaningful.

## What Makes a Good Data Scientist?

Here are a few insights I wrote down during the talks:

1. **Read the literature.** Be aware, so to speak.
2. **Simplify until it can’t be simplified anymore.** If you can explain it simply, you understand it.
3. **Modify how you solve problems.** Be flexible, not formulaic. Try out and adjust.
4. **Discuss.** New ideas are born in conversation.
5. **Theorize.** And if someone gives you a theory? Test it.
6. **Write.** Science is always a collective effort — and writing is how your thinking contributes to that. It also helps to learn to communicate thought in a clear and succint way.

## Topics I Want to Explore Deeper

The conference gave me more than just a long list of unknown terms — it gave me the overall feeling of the field and possible directions to explore, listening to the variety of what's been going on for the last years. Here’s what caught my attention:

- **GRAPHS.** It is a way to represent things and relationships between them. Graphs help to see patterns, connections, and networks that aren’t obvious in a table of data.It’s made of nodes (things, e.g., people, cities, websites) and edges (connections, e.g., friendships, roads, hyperlinks).

Map: nodes = cities, edges = roads

Applications:

- Finding the shortest route (GPS apps)
- Detecting communities (social network clusters)
- Recommending products or friends (by looking at connections)

- **LLMs (Large Language Models).** AI models trained on huge amounts of text, designed to understand and generate human-like text. My lovely ChatGPT. <3 Yet, what interests me — is how they come to be?
  Auto-complete in my email is powered by a smaller LLM.

- **ILP. (Integer Linear Programming).** I had no idea what this means. But I wanted to find out. (Honestly, doesn’t it sound beautiful?)

It is a mathematical way to make the best choice in situations with constraints, where the choices are whole numbers.

It helps solve optimization problems in logistics, scheduling, or planning.

“math-based optimizer” that deals with real-world restrictions.

Also, there was a question about `P = NP`. I HAVE to know what this is about.

All in all, I got to see really intelligent people who speak about all this stuff and understand it. Isn't it amazing?! :)
