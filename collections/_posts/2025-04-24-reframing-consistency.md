I can feel the pressure building inside.

<p class="notation">I’ve noticed that my posts have been leaning more and more toward reflection rather than technical nuances—and I want to embrace that. This, too, is part of the journey. And in my understanding of things, the first 'item' I wish to understand is me myself.</p>

There’s a voice in me that whispers, "If you gave your word, you _must_ follow through—no matter what." (I'm talking about posting here consistently).\
It is great to be responsible, yet I sense the shadow of perfectionism in it.

_If you’re sick, if you work—doesn’t matter. Sacrifice your sleep then, do whatever it takes, just complete the task!_

But then I ask myself:

## Why did I begin this experiment in the first place?

To learn.  
To grow.  
To explore what interests me.

And yes, I promised myself 52 weeks of learning. Yes, I imagined them as 52 _consecutive_ weeks.

But I also promised myself to walk this path with joy, with _love_ to what I do. So I should consider consistency in a context of events happening in my life. And whether or not I truly hide or things are moving in reality.

I don’t want this project to become another weight on my shoulders. I want it to be a steady path of exploration—with trust in myself that I will continue.

This is not only about getting a new skill for me, it is about _what life do I live_ acquiring the skill.

## What is the context?

Actually, there’s so much I want to write about.

I went to a Data Conference and wrote down new concepts I have no idea about yet, found new ideas I’d love to explore.\
I’ve discovered new books I'd like to read (at least to begin to read and decide whether or not to continue).\
I learned a bit about classification, graphs, matrices—and realized just how much math I need to revisit.

Things _are_ moving. But I haven’t had the time to put it all into words. And day by day, the weight of not-posting just… piles up. I bit more than I can chew. But then again—

## Who am I doing this for?

Right now, I’m at a moment where I am ready to give myself as much time as I need, not rushing anywhere, even if the world of data seems to be dashing forward. I want to take my time.

To really **understand** things. To uncover real math behind algorithms, why they are doing what they are doing. To see the field of Data Science from different angles—different authors and tutors, to form my own understanding.

And most of all, I want to **live** through the process.

So here I am. Not perfect. Showing up.
