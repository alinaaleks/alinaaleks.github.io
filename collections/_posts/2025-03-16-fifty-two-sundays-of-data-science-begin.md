They say **you will truly excel in something you feel you can do forever** â€” or for free.

Let's see... Learning something, asking questions, pondering, all-things-music... _Can I work as a forever-student professional??!_

You see, over the years I've tried different fields, professions, occasional unemployments ðŸ˜… The pattern? A jack-of-all-trades â€” master of none. Or, rather, an expert of none.

The time has come to deepen knowledge in one field. Besides, Data Science does seem versatile enough for my curious nature. But what Iâ€™m most excited to see is **what concentrated focus can achieve.** What will happen? I think even without natural abilities it should yield tangible results.

So here's the plan:

## The 52 Sundays Manifest

**A yearlong experiment in learning Data Science, writing, and showing up.**

**First Sunday** - 23-03-2025. **52nd Sunday** - 15-03-2026

- _Use writing to document progress and_ explore how it can also _reinforce learning._ Which answers could be answered with 'data tools'?
- _Show up consistently_ â€” 52 Sundays, 52 posts.
- _No perfectionism!_ Better a finished project than an eternally perfect draft.
- _Finish three Data Science books_ from cover to cover. These are not my only resources, but I'm truly interested in what dedicated study in one source can do.

## Role Model

It resulted in me realizing that I want a place for freedom and creativity. Thatâ€™s how this website was born [1 - website creation] â€” with a few adventures, but at the end of the day (or rather, at the beginning of the next day) it was up and running. Well, not online yet..

<p class="notation">..Dear article, there were times you looked like this <u>http://127.0.0.1:4000/blog/fifty-two-sundays-manifest</u>, remember?..</p>

ChatGPT made me more fearless in a way. Before, I wouldnâ€™t have known how to approach certain gaps in my knowledge, but now **experiments feel so accessible.**

Just try them out and commit. Now, that's a role model.

Here goes.
