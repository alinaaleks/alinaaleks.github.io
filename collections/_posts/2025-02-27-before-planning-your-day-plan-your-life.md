  From vision - through planning - into the action.

I try **not to do things unless I understand _why_ I’m doing them.** While I don’t have complete clarity in all areas at all times, I do in some, and I focus on those. For the _cloudy_ areas, I work on bringing clarity. One helpful approach I use is **top-to-bottom planning**. Or **backwards engineering.** Sounds more techy :)

## The How

It happens differently each time, as a creative spontaneous act, but the gist remains the same &mdash; long-term vision is unfolding back into the present moment.

<p class="notation">Below is a flowchart illustrating the exact steps I took this time.</p>

## The Why

Big planning gives me this clarity I long for and life becomes more focused. With the big picture in mind, it’s easier to understand **which actions will produce the best results.**

So, for example, &mdash; after I realized the career direction I'm interested in, I first saw how it fit into the overall picture of life. => From there I moved into the life project called “Career”, => then into the goals inside it, => researched for materials, => prepared them, and voila! A week later I’m all set and ready to begin with my studies! 🤭

It may feel like it steals a lot of time, but in reality it saves a lot of time in the future. Actually, I love to spend time on planning, thinking, structuring, especially when I get to see its implementation and the benefits it brings (=real life results).

I know my plan will change and it is normal. Now I have some portion of information, then with time I will discover another perspectives, and will adjust my vision.

And so on.
