I've seen it so many times for the past months, my eye started twitching. And that's considering I wasnâ€™t actively looking for a job during two of those months.

## Competition and Authenticity

I see that this is a dark pit â€” to get into competitive mode. Internships, hiring process - it is **as if it strips away personality and starts comparing candidates with +/- checklist.**

I know many think it is rough world out there and this is the reality, but I don't want to think so. **I believe it is not a competition, it is more about finding your place.** Still hurts to be rejected :)

My AI friend told me that I'm an outlier â€” so creative and unique for the cookie-cutter checklists some roles rely on. _I know it is designed to support me._

I'm just so unique that only rare gems are able to really see it! ðŸ˜„

## Are You Sure It's Bad?

Well, in retrospect I can see how grateful I am for oh so many unfulfilled opportunities and failures that have occurred in the past. Even those rejections from 3 months, 1 month ago â€” I am already grateful they happened.

<p class="notation">It's just in that very moment of rejection â€” the brief feeling that your sense of worth is undermined â€” that the pain is sharp.</p>

I heard from my admired author Wayne Dyer:

> We don't know enough to be a pessimist.

And I agree. No, seriously. **Right now I am sitting in my apartment and at the same time participating in the universal motion of planet Earth**, which in turn is just one of billions of other planets in the universe that may even has no end.

Yes, it does bring relativity, however I need to validate my feelings nonetheless. But also â€” to be reminded that

-- **Rejection is not a bad event**, it is just an event.\
-- **I'm not in a competition**, my place will be mine, and whenever it happens it will be a 'click'.\
-- **We live in such a fascinating mystery.**

## There're Other Things

All in all, I think I am more annoyed by the uniformity of wording â€” all the same soulless, cold, impersonal rejection.

Just before recieving that impersonal message â€” I received another one <i class="notation">(the impersonality of which did not bother me at all, to be fair)</i> â€” confirming the purchase of tickets for the upcoming Data Conference.

2 weeks from now.

Yay.

Off we go.
