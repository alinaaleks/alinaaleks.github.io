They say **you will truly excel in something you feel you can do forever** — or for free.

Let's see... Learning something, asking questions, pondering, all-things-music... _Can I work as a forever-student professional??! ..playing bongo.._

Over the years I have noticed that I gravitate towards collecting and organizing, trying to develop workable system, which will be improving those very things I collected and organized. That, out of messy 'something' comes a system that works and makes this 'something' easy to use. Or even a bit easier.

Improvement. It feels like growth.

I believe that tools used for Analytics, Data Science, Data Architecture (or else) could be very useful for my current amateurish (yet experienced 🤭) view and approach.

## So, here's the idea:

- _Use writing to explore_ - Which questions could be answered/Which problems could be solved with 'data tools'?
- _No perfectionism!_ Better a finished project than an eternally perfect draft.
- _Finish three Data Science books_ from cover to cover. These are not my only resources, but I'm truly interested in what dedicated study in one (or three) source can do.

ChatGPT made me more fearless in a way. Before, I wouldn’t have known how to approach certain gaps in my knowledge, but now **experiments feel so accessible.**

Just try them out and commit.
